# Code of Conduct

Same one as [Rust's Code of Conduct], enforced by us with the following things added:

- Don't share personally identifying information of other people, including the authors and any
  contributors. Be thoughtful of your own, too. With great power comes great responsibility. (I
  have no idea why the Rust CoC doesn't contain this)

- Although the application is written in both German and English, use English as
  communication language.
